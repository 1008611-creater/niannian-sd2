# Frame Manifest Schema

Use one row per exported frame. Rows must point to source-resolution PNG frames under `reference_frames_original/`. Contact sheets are preview-only and must not be used as redraw reference images.

`source-resolution` means exact equality with the source video's current `ffprobe` video-stream `width` and `height`, not equality with the first extracted image and not a `width >= 720` heuristic. The strict validator checks every PNG in `reference_frames_original/`, `shotlevel_start_mid_end_frames/`, and `transnet_shots/keyframes/`. A single mismatch blocks `step01_evidence_manifest.json`.

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| order | sorted output order |
| file | frame filename |
| time_sec | source time in seconds |
| timecode | `HH:MM:SS.mmm` |
| frame_index | source video frame index |
| shot_id | detected shot number |
| reason | `shot_start`, `shot_mid`, `shot_mid_sharp`, `shot_end`, `motion`, `motion_interval`, `subtitle_change`, `dialogue_start`, `dialogue_end`, `audio_event`, `audio_event_mid`, `baseline`, `coverage`, `key_change` |
| sharpness | Laplacian sharpness score |
| motion_score | local motion or visual change score |

The manifest must be sorted by `time_sec`.

Final frame count for redraw work must prioritize shot coverage over compactness. Do not default to 80-100 frames for normal short-drama episodes. The default extraction script uses `unbounded_evidence_coverage`: no fixed cap, keeping every shot start/mid/end, sharp mid-shot candidate, subtitle change, key visual change, and dense motion interval needed for reconstruction and Step 04 shot prompt anchoring. Use `--bounded` only for legacy review packets or explicit fixed-count requests.

When audio evidence exists first, pass dialogue, silence, breath, emotion, offscreen speech, or story information-cue ledgers to `extract_episode_frames.py --audio-events <csv-or-json>`. The extractor will add start/mid/end frame candidates around those audio events so the visual evidence follows the actual performance timing instead of relying on visual change alone. Do not pass post-added sound-effect, audio-peak, music-hit, or background-music ledgers into the redraw workflow.

When a full episode is too dense or likely to time out, split evidence into 60-second chunks. Keep the merged episode manifest as the canonical manifest, and also write `minute_chunks/EPXXX_minute_chunks_index.json` plus per-minute CSV/JSON manifests for review.

Dense shot-level supplements are required for redraw production. Export each detected shot's start/mid/end frame to `shotlevel_start_mid_end_frames/` and write `shotlevel_start_mid_end_manifest.csv/json`. This supplement may exceed the main reference-frame count because its purpose is analysis and prompt anchoring, not compact review.

The accepted supplement is keyed to the accepted TransNetV2 table, not merely to an older OpenCV shot count. For every `transnet_shots/EPXXX_transnet_shots.csv` `shot_id`, the supplement must contain exactly one `start`, one `mid`, and one `end` row with `source_detector=transnetv2`, a readable native-resolution PNG, and the corresponding source frame index. Duplicate rows, missing points, extra shot IDs, row-count-only matches, or non-TransNet supplements fail closed. `enhance_episode_evidence.py` regenerates the supplement after TransNet acceptance.

- `EPXXX_shot_list.csv`: one row per detected shot, with start or end seconds, timecodes, frames, and duration.
- `audio/EPXXX_16k_mono.wav`: mono 16kHz WAV for ASR when ffmpeg is available.
- `EPXXX_transcript_segments.csv/json`: Mimo ASR transcript segments with Qwen3-ForcedAligner timestamps when available. Qwen3-ASR output is invalid and must not be consumed. Speaker is unresolved unless a second-pass speaker layer runs.

- `EPXXX_asr_handoff.md`: transcript tool recommendation and speaker attribution rules.
- `reference_frames_original/`: ordered original-resolution PNG reference frames.
- `minute_chunks/`: optional 60-second chunk manifests for long or dense extractions; use these to review each `第几分钟内容` without dropping frames.
- `shotlevel_start_mid_end_frames/`: required dense supplement with one start, middle, and end frame per detected shot.
- `shotlevel_start_mid_end_manifest.csv/json`: required supplement manifest with `shot_id`, `point`, `time_sec`, `timecode`, `frame_index`, `source_start`, `source_end`, `file`, and `path`.
